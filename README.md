# Demonstration Node.js API Application


This repository contains an extremely simple Node.js API app.

If you'd like to run the example locally, make sure you have Node.js and `npm` installed, then do the following (from within this repository's directory):

  1. `npm install`
  2. `node app.js`

After the app starts listening, you should be able to send a request to `http://localhost:8080/hello/dave`, and get back a response like `hello dave`.
